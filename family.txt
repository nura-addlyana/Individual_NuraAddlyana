Thats makes her 53 years old. She is a housewife. However, she likes to help my father by sewing clothes. Unlike my father, my mother looks friendly but actually intimidating and scary. She is a savage. You dont want to mess with her.</p>
     
     	<font size="6" face="lorem ipsum">
     			<p style="color:SaddleBrown;"align= "center">My Older Sister, her husband and son</p></font>

Their son's name is Muhammad Danial Asyraf bin Ahmad Zamzuri. My sister was born on 16th March 1992 at Hospital Sungai Petani, Kedah. She is 30 years old. Both my sister and her husband are currently waiting for their second child to be born this February. They got married back in 2018. My sister was the scary older sister that everyone have but actually really loving one. She always treat us siblings to a lot of thing. </p>

     			<p style="color:SaddleBrown;"align="center">My Older Brother</p></font>
       			<p style="color:Peru;"align= "center">My older brother's name is Mohamad Khairil bin Hassan. He was born at Hospital Sungai Petani as my older sister on 6th July 1995. Thats makes him 27 years old. He currently still studying by pursuing his master in music at University of Malaya. Unlike any others male sibling, he is the only one in the family. Thats why he is soft and understand more about girls. However, he is kind of annoying when he's mad.</p>
     
     	<font size="6" face="lorem ipsum">
     			<p style="color:SaddleBrown;"align= "center">My Younger Sister</p></font>
        		<p style="color:Peru;"align= "center">Lastly, my younger sister'name is Nura Azlyani binti Hassan. She was born at Hospital Taiping same as me on 16th October 2003. Thats make her 19 years old. She currently pursuing study in STPM. As the youngest, she basically stuck at home. She is much taller than me and my older sister. I like to annoy her just to get her reaction on it. Unlike my brother, she is the hard one maybe because she is still not mature yet.</p>
